This is a Hack assembler written in Python, besides the basic requirements it also checks the validity.
The architecture is shitty and the program is not expected to be developed any further. 

How-to:
   invoke in command line: ./HackAssembler.py input_file.asm output_filename
      - assumes that input_file resides in the same directory as HackAssembler.py
      - input_file.asm has to have .asm extension and is expected to contain Hack assembly.
      - output_filename is as name indicates - name of a file that will contain machine code for Hack Computer
