   This is my attempt at the popular Nand2Tetris course at coursera (and corresponding book "The Elements of Computing Systems, Buildling a Modern Computer from First Principles by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken").
   
   This comes down to buidling a computer from the very scratch, starting from NAND gates and going up and up until we finish with a game ("tetris").
